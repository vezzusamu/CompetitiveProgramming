The problem goal is to execute for an Array A of n positive integers, two 
different queries: 
1) Update: that replaces every value in the given range with the minimum 
between the current element of the array and a value given as function 
input, called value_cap
2) Max: that return the largest element in the given range
Example: A = [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] 	
Update(1,2,2)  => A = [2, 1, 4, 3, 2]
Max(2,4) = 4
The target time complexity is Î˜((n + m)log n) where m is the number of 
total queries to perform.
