The problem goal is to perform m increment operations on a given array A 
of n integers. Each operation must be performed a number of times 
identified by k queries, each query indicates the operations that have to 
be performed.
The problem is offline, so the solution can execute the operations in any 
order.
The solution should run in Î˜((k + m) log n + n).
Example: A = [1, 2, 3] 	
M[1]=[1, 2, 1] //left bound, right bound, value to add
M[2] = [1, 2, 1]
M[3] = [1, 3, 2]
Q[1] = [1, 2] //Query range to execute
Q[2] = [1, 3]
Q[3] = [2, 3]
Output => 9 8 17
